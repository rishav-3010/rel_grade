## 🎯 Why This Exists

### The VIT Revaluation Dilemma

**The Problem:**
- VIT releases marks on (e.g.) **March 23rd**
- Grades are released **7 days later** on **March 30th**
- Students can apply for revaluation for **₹400 per subject**
- Revaluations typically increase marks by **0-2 marks maximum**
- **BUT** you don't know the grade bands until grades are released!

**The Question:**
> *"Should I spend ₹400 on revaluation without knowing if it will actually improve my grade?"*

### The Solution

This tool helps you make an **informed decision** by calculating the exact grade bands **before official grades are released**.

#### Example 1: ✅ Revaluation Worth It
```
Your Mark: 65
Calculated Grade Bands:
  A Grade: 66-79
  B Grade: 54-65  ← You're here

Decision: APPLY for reval! 
Even 1 mark increase (65→66) = A grade
₹400 investment = Worth it! 💰
```

#### Example 2: ❌ Revaluation NOT Worth It
```
Your Mark: 74
Calculated Grade Bands:
  A Grade: 71-82  ← You're here
  B Grade: 60-70

Decision: DON'T apply for reval
Even 2 marks increase (74→76) = Still A grade
Save your ₹400! 💵
```

#### Example 3: 🎯 On the Edge
```
Your Mark: 70
Calculated Grade Bands:
  A Grade: 71-82
  B Grade: 60-70  ← You're here

Decision: High Risk, High Reward
Need minimum 1 mark increase to get A
If you're confident, apply! Otherwise, save ₹400
```

### Decision Matrix

| Your Situation | Your Mark | Next Grade Cutoff | Gap | Reval Worth It? |
|----------------|-----------|-------------------|-----|-----------------|
| **Safe Zone** | 74 | A: 71-82 | -3 marks | ❌ NO - Save ₹400 |
| **Edge Case** | 65 | A: 66-79 | +1 mark | ✅ YES - Apply! |
| **Border** | 70 | A: 71-82 | +1 mark | ⚠️ Maybe - Your call |
| **Far Below** | 60 | A: 71-82 | +11 marks | ❌ NO - Unrealistic |
| **Already Top** | 85 | S: 94+ | N/A | ❌ NO - Already A |

### Smart Decision Tips

✅ **APPLY for Reval if:**
- You're 1-2 marks below the next grade cutoff
- Improving one grade level (B→A, C→B, etc.)
- The ₹400 is worth it for your career (campus placements, higher studies)

❌ **DON'T APPLY if:**
- You're safely in the middle of a grade band
- You need 3+ marks to reach next grade (unlikely with reval)
- You're already in S or A grade (diminishing returns)
- The subject doesn't significantly impact your CGPA

## 🚀 Quick Start

## 🔧 Configuration

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Description | Required |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` | Google OAuth 2.0 Client ID | Yes |
| `MONGO_URI` | MongoDB connection string | Yes |
| `PORT` | Server port (default: 3000) | No |

### Access Control

To restrict access to specific emails only, uncomment this section in `server.js`:

```javascript
// Uncomment to restrict to allowed emails only
if (!allowedEmails.includes(email)) {
  console.log(`❌ Unauthorized email: ${email}`);
  return res.status(403).json({ success: false });
}
```

## 📊 Grading Algorithm

The system uses **relative grading** based on statistical distribution:

### Calculation Method

1. **Mean (μ)** - Average of all submitted marks
2. **Standard Deviation (σ)** - Measure of spread

### Grade Cutoffs

| Grade | Formula | Description |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| **S** | μ + 1.5σ (min 80) | Outstanding |
| **A** | μ + 0.5σ | Excellent |
| **B** | μ - 0.5σ | Good |
| **C** | μ - 1.0σ | Average |
| **D** | μ - 1.5σ | Below Average |
| **E** | μ - 2.0σ (max 50) | Pass |
| **F** | < Pass Mark | Fail |

### Example Calculation

```
Marks: [85, 78, 92, 65, 88, 75, 80, 90, 82, 87]

Mean (μ) = 82.2
Standard Deviation (σ) = 7.8

Grade Bands:
S: ≥ 94 (82.2 + 1.5×7.8)
A: ≥ 86 and < 94
B: ≥ 78 and < 86
C: ≥ 74 and < 78
D: ≥ 70 and < 74
E: ≥ 50 and < 70
F: < 50
```

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**❌ "MongoDB connection error"**
- Check your MongoDB URI format
- Verify database user credentials
- Whitelist your IP address in MongoDB Atlas
- Ensure database name exists in URI

**❌ "Google OAuth not working"**
- Verify Client ID matches in `.env` and `index.html`
- Check authorized origins in Google Cloud Console
- Clear browser cookies and try again
- Ensure HTTPS in production

**❌ "Access denied" error**
- Verify email is in `allowedEmails` array
- Check if you're using VIT student email
- Ensure email restriction code is commented/uncommented correctly

**❌ "Mark already submitted"**
- This is intentional - one submission per student
- To reset, delete user document from MongoDB

**❌ Session expires immediately**
- Check `cookie.secure` setting (should be `false` for localhost)
- Verify `express-session` is properly configured
- Clear browser cookies

### Debug Mode
